# Welcome to Alchemy Persistor web site

## Abstract

Alchemy Persistor is a module for the [Vert.x][2] web framework that allow you to persist your data
models using Python [Sql Alchemy][1].

This module allows data to be saved, retrieved, searched for, and deleted in a [Sql Alchemy][1] managed database.

It is inspired from [mongo persistor][3], which I use as a starting skeleton for the project, and from
which I take the format for all json command.

To get started, see [Getting started][4]
